Project Proposal: Housing Affordability in Melbourne, Victoria

We start our presentation by looking at the growth of house prices in Melbourne from 2013 to 2023.
We have decided to concentrate on just house prices in the whole of Melbourne so we can minimize our range of variables and define our analysis according to changes in prices over time for houses vs other variables.

Our analysis aims to address several key questions:

1)Population:
Price increase vs Population growth from 2013 to 2023
Does Population Growth affect Rising House Prices?

2)Interest Rates,
Inflation(CPI) &
Household Debt to income vs House Prices
How does Interest Rates, Inflation & Household Debt to Income affect House Affordability"?

3)School Rankings vs Suburb House Growth Prices
How does the rank of schools within a suburb influence the annual growth rate of house prices? â€‹
Is there a correlation between the per annum growth of house prices and the school rank of the suburb?

4)Salary vs House Prices
Does Salary affect House Prices?
Is there correlation between Salary and House Prices?

5)Conclusion - Future House Price Affordability
How will Housing Affordability be affected in the future?
